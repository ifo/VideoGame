Game type ideas:

- A simple real time strategy game, resembling the Phoenix egg guarding in Final Fantasy 7, or the game play type of Ogre Battle.

- Side-scrolling space shooter (ala Gradius) where you can slow down and speed up time.

- Hive - A strategy/simulation game where you manage a beehive, forage for pollen/nectar, build honeycomb, and defend against attacks.

- Prism - A puzzle game where you use different shaped mirrors to guide a laser from start to finish and pick up power-ups and points along the way.

- Profit?

- FOB (Forward Operating Base) a tower defense... on steroids, i have been thinking of this idea for a while!
